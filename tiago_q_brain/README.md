## Doubts to be cleared in the code:
 1.default uncertain data scalar reading encoding in the qubits.
 
 2.during the decision process unable to see the circuit encode values, 
 
 3.if all(last_n_qubits) == 1: not sure about this whether match the scenario ,just need the clearance to this.
 as per the simulation it matches but need some error correction in the script.
